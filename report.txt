FAT32 image utility report
============================

Problem statement:
============================
The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with three concepts: basic file-system design and
implementation, file-system image testing, and data serialization/de-serialization. You will need to
understand various aspects of the FAT32 file system such as cluster-based storage, FAT tables, sectors,
directory structure, and byte-ordering (endianness). You will also be introduced to mounting and unmounting
of file system images onto a running Linux system, data serialization (converting data structures
into raw bytes for storage or network transmissions), and de-serialization (converting serialized bytes into
data structures again).

Steps taken to solve problem
============================
1. Opened and studied fat32 image provided with a hex editor
2. Implemented bootsector parsing functions
3. Implemented user input parsing
4. Created utilities for code reusability
5. Implemented commands to be executed

Assumptions
============================
- File and directory names will not contain spaces.
- You may assume that STRING always begins and ends with QUOTES
- FILE_NAME and DIR_NAME will only contain the names, not multi-level paths. For example,
"create afile" will create a file named afile in the current directory. It does not have to support
commands like "create adirectory/afile"
- Unless specified, you may choose any reasonable data type for the arguments and return values
for your functions

Known Bugs
============================
- Program segfaults when only "enter" is the user input
- Program can take from ~10-60 seconds to correctly reflect changes made to the file system when a file is modified/added/removed while the program is running
