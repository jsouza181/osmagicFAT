FAT32 image utility report
============================

Problem statement:
============================
The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with three concepts: basic file-system design and
implementation, file-system image testing, and data serialization/de-serialization. You will need to
understand various aspects of the FAT32 file system such as cluster-based storage, FAT tables, sectors,
directory structure, and byte-ordering (endianness). You will also be introduced to mounting and unmounting
of file system images onto a running Linux system, data serialization (converting data structures
into raw bytes for storage or network transmissions), and de-serialization (converting serialized bytes into
data structures again).

Steps taken to solve problem
============================
1. Opened and studied fat32 image provided with a hex editor
2. Implemented bootsector parsing functions
3. Implemented user input parsing
4. Created utilities for code reusability
5. Implemented commands to be executed

Assumptions
============================
- File and directory names will not contain spaces.
- write command STRING always begins and ends with QUOTES
- FILE_NAME and DIR_NAME will only contain the names, not multi-level paths.
- Writing to a file is based on the assumption that the file exists in the current directory, if it exists at all.

Basic Modules
============================
- commands.c: The main implementation of specific commands.
- direntries.c: Utilities to handle operations specific to directory entries.
- main.c: Handles user I/O and initializes program-wide data.
- metadata.c: Functions to retrieve metadata from the boot sector when the program first executes.
- utilities.c: Utility functions for miscellaneous operations as well as FAT Table access operations.
- utilities.h: Definitions for important structs such as directory entries.

Important data
============================
- fileImgPtr: File pointer used to navigate the FAT32 image.
- fsMetadata: Stores important metadata from the boot sector.
- ofTable: Table that stores all currently open files as open file entries.
- currentDir(main scope): Directory structure which represents the current directory and is populated after each command.


Known Bugs
============================
- Program segfaults when only "enter" is the user input
- Program can take from ~10-60 seconds to correctly reflect changes made to the file system when a file is modified/added/removed while the program is running

Missing Features
============================
- When creating a new directory, the directory's . and .. entries are not created.

Division of Labor
